# Boxenite
* development servers that don't suck
* code syncing between multiple devices
* store code locally or on your development server (hello enterprise - give me your money)
* Easily share your development
* Add-on Services
  * DB Proxy - easily control what databases and queries are allowed by your development servers
  * CI for all development servers
  * Slack, of course.

Problem: Configuration work is a hassle and small differences create large problems. Sharing configuration takes work that should be already built into your minimal workflow. 
Why can't I pull any repo and start working on it immediately without having to configure my machine? 
I could use things like vagrant, but why isn't this shit just happening automagically? 
The sharing mechanism needs to already do the dirty work and live natively inside my workflow
