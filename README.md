# Boxenite
* development servers that don't suck
* code syncing between multiple devices
* store code locally or on your development server (hello enterprise - give me your money)
* Easily share your development


Why can't I pull any repo and start working on it immediately without having to configure my machine? 
I could use things like vagrant, but why isn't this shit just happening automagically? 
The sharing mechanism needs to already do the dirty work and live natively inside my workflow

* install server
* create DB, migrate DB
* run
