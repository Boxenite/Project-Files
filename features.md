### Boxenite
*  Definition: a single directory that contains all your coding projects
*  User Feeling: Development should "feel" like you are coding locally.
*  User Feeling: This folder is goddamn magical - I throw any project in it and it takes care of configuration, building an environment, and creates a super fast experience for me with my tools, the way I want it. 

Experiences:
* every new project or file should be executable, regardless of the local environment (exception of xcode and mobile projects)
* everything in the folder should execute on a remote server made specifically for the code
* I can easily share a project to anyone - and it drops into their devbox immediately - and is consistent with my environment. 

### Possible Features
* create a new project easily
* add existing projects locally or from repository
* share a project to someone else's devbox very easily
* drag and drop to a folder for adding a project
* add your github repos (automatically?)
* account creation, email based. 
* automatically handle ssh key process
* git ready
* connect all my favorite editors to my devbox (local pointers to the remote file system?)
* enable offline (local version) 

* host mobile code (xcode and android) technically possible

### CORPORATE CLIENT FEATURES
* extremely simple admin tool for account provisioning
* mass invite people to devbox
* account and billing

### Pricing Model
* Possible to do public vs. private development server model? 


### Misc
this starts to get more and more competitive
