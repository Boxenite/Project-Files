##Building the MVP

- [ ] unison data container
- [ ] provisioning data containers, app containers and supporting containers (database etc)
- [ ] client side create flow, ssh into your dev box
- [ ] sharing snapshot


####User Experience
* select git repository
* minimally configure containers needed
* open editor / terminal and start working on it

####Under the hood
* authentication to bxe, github
* clone git repository to boxenite directory local, bxe init the folder
* receive configuration and send it to server
* build remote environment
* ssh into the server whenever you cd into the folder
* go go go!

####TBD
* sharing - snapshot etc
