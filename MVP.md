###Boxenite

Vagrant, Docker, etc. - they all are fantastic tools but lack a simple experience that impacts enterprise users and individual engineers. We are going to backdoor this product into every enterprise because it will be THE way engineers start, collaborate and work on their projects.

**MVP - Development Servers that Just Work**
* Adding a project or file to your Boxenite Folder creates a remote development server, immediately. 
* syncing between your machine and the development server (real time)
* to the user, EVERYTHING must feel like they are running it on their own machine. Absolutely no learning curve. 
* cloning repository to your boxenite folder is the only action you have to take to get up and running
* support 3-5 most popular project types
* * Free to use for development (we will eat the cost on MVP)
* **unlocks:** Use Case 1,2,3,4

***


V1 - keeping your local synced between computers
* anything you add to the folder gets synced across your devices
* syncing doesn't break git or editors
* account creation, easy sharing, easy adding from github repos
* **unlocks:** Use Case 5

V3 - enterprise

###Important to the Model
* forever free for open source
* private repositories come at a cost

###Use Cases
1. I want to share my project with someone else
2. I want to invite someone else to my project and to my development server environment (database included)
3. I want to jump into a new project without dealing with dependencies
4. I want to share my development or production configuration and integration testing to anyone or specific people
5. I want my code synced across my different computers


* share a project to someone else's devbox very easily
* drag and drop to a folder for adding a project
* add your github repos (automatically?)
* account creation, email based. 
* automatically handle ssh key process
* git ready
* connect all my favorite editors to my devbox (local pointers to the remote file system?)
* enable offline (local version) 

* host mobile code (xcode and android) technically possible

### CORPORATE CLIENT FEATURES
* extremely simple admin tool for account provisioning
* mass invite people to devbox
* account and billing

### Pricing Model
* Possible to do public vs. private development server model? 


### Misc
this starts to get more and more competitive


### Keys to Growth
* people must be able to use the product without their company needing to have it (unless enterprise size - dropbox)
* fix the part that keeps people from using it - dropbox fixed the syncing
*
