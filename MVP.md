MVP - keeping your local synced between computers
* messaging: dropbox for engineers
  * anything you add to the folder gets synced
  * syncing doesn't break git or editors
  * account creation, easy sharing, easy adding from github repos

***

* sync projects between devices
* account creation - email and password
* easily add your github repositories
* maintain git / subversion integrity - git local is on the server. git remote is github
* simple gui, like menubar app

V2 - MVP + remote deploy for development
* messaging: dropbox + heroku
* command line tool with commands like "boxenite start"
* detect dependencies, build and run the app on the right container
* possible syncing service between server and the container for real time changes
 

V2 (Enterprise V1)
* 
* On-Prem

* drag and drop to a folder for adding a project
* add your github repos (automatically?)
* account creation, email based. 
* automatically handle ssh key process
* git ready
* connect all my favorite editors to my devbox (local pointers to the remote file system?)
* enable offline (local version) 

* host mobile code (xcode and android) technically possible

### CORPORATE CLIENT FEATURES
* extremely simple admin tool for account provisioning
* mass invite people to devbox
* account and billing

### Pricing Model
* Possible to do public vs. private development server model? 


### Misc
this starts to get more and more competitive


### Keys to Growth
* people must be able to use the product without their company needing to have it (unless enterprise size - dropbox)
* fix the part that keeps people from using it - dropbox fixed the syncing
*
