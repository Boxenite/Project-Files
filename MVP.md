###Important to the Model
* forever free for open source
* private repositories come at a cost
***
###Use Cases
1. I want my code synced across my different computers
2. I want to share my project with someone else
3. I want to invite someone else to my project and to my development server environment (database included)
4. I want to jump into a new project without dealing with dependencies
5. I want to run anything without having to install dependencies
6. I want to share my development or production configuration and integration testing to anyone or specific people

V2 (Enterprise V1)
* On-Prem

* share a project to someone else's devbox very easily
* drag and drop to a folder for adding a project
* add your github repos (automatically?)
* account creation, email based. 
* automatically handle ssh key process
* git ready
* connect all my favorite editors to my devbox (local pointers to the remote file system?)
* enable offline (local version) 

* host mobile code (xcode and android) technically possible

### CORPORATE CLIENT FEATURES
* extremely simple admin tool for account provisioning
* mass invite people to devbox
* account and billing

### Pricing Model
* Possible to do public vs. private development server model? 


### Misc
this starts to get more and more competitive


### Keys to Growth
* people must be able to use the product without their company needing to have it (unless enterprise size - dropbox)
* fix the part that keeps people from using it - dropbox fixed the syncing
*
